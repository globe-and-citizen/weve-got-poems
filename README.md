## Overview

"We've Got Poems" is not just a web application; it's a creative haven where users can weave their poetic expressions and share them with the world. This project started as a Proof Of Concept (POC) but has evolved into a showcase of cutting-edge technologies that enhance user experience and security.

## Features

### Layer 8: Anonymizing Reverse Proxy

Dive into the future of online privacy with Layer 8, a suite of network protocol implementations seamlessly integrated into "We've Got Poems." This anonymizing reverse proxy is dedicated to dissociating a user's true identity from their online content choices, ensuring a secure and private environment for creative expression.

### SIWE: Sign-In with Ethereum

Embrace the future of authentication with SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum), an implementation of the EIP-4361 standard. This revolutionary authentication method establishes secure communication between the frontend and backend, providing a robust foundation for user sessions based on a wallet connection. Explore features like Connect Wallet and Sign Message, unlocking a world of possibilities beyond traditional authentication methods.
